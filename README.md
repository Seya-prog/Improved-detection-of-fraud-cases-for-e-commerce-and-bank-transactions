# Improved Fraud Detection for E-commerce and Bank Transactions

This project aims to create accurate and strong fraud detection models for e-commerce transactions and bank credit transactions. It uses machine learning techniques to identify fraudulent activities while minimizing false positives and false negatives.

## Project Structure
- `data/`: Contains the datasets (Fraud_Data.csv, IpAddress_to_Country.csv, creditcard.csv)
- `src/`: Contains source code for data processing, feature engineering, and model building
- `notebooks/`: Jupyter notebooks for exploratory data analysis and model evaluation

## Datasets
1. **Fraud_Data.csv**: E-commerce transaction data
2. **IpAddress_to_Country.csv**: Maps IP addresses to countries
3. **creditcard.csv**: Bank transaction data

## Setup and Installation
1. Clone this repository
2. Install required packages:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Project Tasks
1. Data Analysis and Preprocessing
2. Model Building and Training
3. Model Evaluation and Selection
4. Model Interpretation

## Critical Challenges
- Handling highly imbalanced datasets
- Balancing security with user experience (minimizing false positives and negatives)
